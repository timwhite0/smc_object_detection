# Sequential Monte Carlo for detecting and deblending objects in astronomical images

This branch contains the code for SMC-Deblender, the SMC sampler described in [Sequential Monte Carlo for detecting and deblending objects in astronomical images](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2023/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2023_172.pdf).

See the `experiments/smc_vs_sep` directory for a set of experiments that is similar to those presented in the paper. The original repository for this paper can be accessed [here](https://github.com/timwhite0/smcdeblender).
