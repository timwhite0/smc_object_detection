# Waste-free sequential Monte Carlo for light source detection in astronomical images

## STATS 608 final project, winter 2024

## Jaylin Lowe and Tim White

Waste-free sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) is an extension of SMC that was recently proposed by [Dau and Chopin (2022)](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/84/1/114/7056097). In this report, we conduct numerical experiments to assess the utility of embedding this waste-free procedure within an SMC sampler designed for a challenging Bayesian inverse problem that requires transdimensional inference: detecting and distinguishing overlapping light sources in astronomical images.
